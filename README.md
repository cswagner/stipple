[Stippling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stippling) is the creation of a pattern simulating varying degrees of solidity of shading by using small dots. Darker regions are represented by a high-density region of dots; lighter regions are represented by a low-density region of dots.

stipple creates a similar representation of an image in Matlab using a matrix of evenly spaced rectangles with varying dimensions. Darker regions are represented by a region of larger rectangles; lighter regions are represented by a region of smaller rectangles.
